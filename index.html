    <h1>How To Get The Most Out Of Your Noodle Report</h1>

    <h3>What is a Noodle Report</h3>

    <p>Now judging by the title of this page, I'm sure some of you are thinking, "What is a Noodle Report?"
        To those of you that have the app TikTok, most of you will know exactly what I'm talking about.
        You see, Noodle is a famous pug on TikTok, that obviously has bones in his body, but some days he decides not to use them. 
        The days that Noodle decides not to use his bones is called a "no bones day", while the days that he does wake up and decide to use his bone are called "bones day". 
        There are many people who will decide what type of day they are going to have based on Noodle's daily report.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>In this page I plan to explain to you how you can use Noodle's report to your fullest advantage.
        Now there is more to than just the Noodle Report to determine your day, it also plays into how you are feeling that morning as well.
        Keep that in mind.</p>
